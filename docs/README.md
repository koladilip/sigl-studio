# SITL (Scene Illustration Template Language) Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for SITL, a powerful domain-specific language designed for creating detailed, customizable scene illustrations with human figures, objects, and environments.

## Overview

SITL provides an intuitive, English-like syntax for describing complex scenes while offering advanced features for customization, reusability, and domain-specific extensions. The language is built on a modular architecture that separates core functionality from specialized domain knowledge.

## Quick Start

```sitl
// Basic scene creation
DRAW MAN WITH AGE 30 AND BLUE SHIRT
DRAW WOMAN WITH RED DRESS NEXT TO MAN
ADD ENVIRONMENT PARK
DRAW TREE BEHIND PEOPLE
```

## Common Use Cases

### Educational Content
```sitl
LOAD EXTENSION educational
ADD ENVIRONMENT CLASSROOM
DRAW TEACHER WITH PROFESSIONAL ATTIRE
DRAW STUDENTS WITH SCHOOL UNIFORMS SITTING AT DESKS
DRAW BLACKBOARD WITH LESSON CONTENT
```

### Medical Scenarios
```sitl
LOAD EXTENSION hospital
ADD ENVIRONMENT OPERATING_ROOM
DRAW SURGEON WITH SURGICAL_SCRUBS AND MASK
DRAW NURSE WITH STERILE_EQUIPMENT
DRAW PATIENT ON OPERATING_TABLE
```

### Legal Proceedings
```sitl
LOAD EXTENSION court
ADD ENVIRONMENT COURTROOM
DRAW JUDGE WITH JUDICIAL_ROBES AT BENCH
DRAW LAWYER WITH FORMAL_SUIT PRESENTING CASE
DRAW JURY IN JURY_BOX
```

### Transportation Scenes
```sitl
LOAD EXTENSION transportation
ADD ENVIRONMENT AIRPORT
DRAW PILOT WITH AIRLINE_UNIFORM
DRAW PASSENGERS WITH TRAVEL_LUGGAGE
DRAW AIRPLANE IN BACKGROUND
```

## Getting Started

### Basic Scene Creation

1. **Start with entities**: Begin by drawing basic people and objects
2. **Add attributes**: Customize appearance, age, clothing, and expressions
3. **Set environment**: Add context with environment presets
4. **Position elements**: Arrange entities using spatial relationships
5. **Refine details**: Use templates and variations for fine-tuning

### Example Workflow

```sitl
// Step 1: Create basic entities
DRAW MAN WITH AGE 35
DRAW WOMAN WITH AGE 30

// Step 2: Add specific attributes
UPDATE MAN WITH BUSINESS_SUIT AND BRIEFCASE
UPDATE WOMAN WITH PROFESSIONAL_DRESS AND LAPTOP

// Step 3: Set environment context
ADD ENVIRONMENT OFFICE

// Step 4: Position elements
PLACE MAN AT DESK
PLACE WOMAN NEXT TO MAN

// Step 5: Add environmental details
DRAW OFFICE_FURNITURE
DRAW WINDOWS WITH CITY_VIEW
```

## Extension System

### Loading Extensions

Extensions are loaded automatically when domain-specific entities are used, or can be loaded explicitly:

```sitl
// Automatic loading
DRAW DOCTOR  // Automatically loads hospital extension

// Explicit loading
LOAD EXTENSION hospital
LOAD EXTENSION transportation
LOAD EXTENSION religious
```

### Available Extensions

| Extension | Description | Key Entities |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Hospital** | Medical professionals and environments | Doctor, Nurse, Patient, Medical Equipment |
| **Court/Legal** | Legal system and proceedings | Judge, Lawyer, Courtroom, Legal Documents |
| **Religious** | Religious figures and buildings | Priest, Mosque, Temple, Religious Ceremonies |
| **Transportation** | Vehicles and travel scenarios | Pilot, Train, Airport, Vehicle Interiors |
| **Educational** | Schools and learning environments | Teacher, Student, Classroom, School Equipment |

## Best Practices

### For Beginners

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic entities and gradually add complexity
2. **Use defaults**: Let the system apply appropriate defaults for incomplete specifications
3. **Leverage context**: Set environments to get contextually appropriate defaults
4. **Explore templates**: Use predefined templates for common scenarios

### For Advanced Users

1. **Create templates**: Build reusable components for complex scenes
2. **Use variations**: Leverage the parameter system for fine-grained control
3. **Combine extensions**: Mix domain extensions for complex scenarios
4. **Optimize performance**: Use caching and batching for large scenes

### For Developers

1. **Follow conventions**: Adhere to naming and syntax conventions
2. **Provide defaults**: Always include fallback values for attributes
3. **Validate context**: Check appropriateness of attributes in different contexts
4. **Document extensions**: Provide clear documentation for custom extensions

## Error Handling

SITL provides comprehensive error handling with helpful suggestions:

```sitl
// Typo correction
DRAW MAN WITH BLU SHIRT
// → "Did you mean 'BLUE SHIRT'?"

// Context validation
ADD ENVIRONMENT OFFICE
DRAW MAN WITH SWIMWEAR
// → "Swimwear inappropriate for office environment. Consider business attire."

// Missing attributes
DRAW MAN WITH BLUE SHIRT
// → "Pants not specified, using default black pants"
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Entity limits**: Recommended maximum of 100 detailed entities per scene
- **Extension loading**: Load only necessary extensions to minimize memory usage
- **Template caching**: Frequently used templates are cached for better performance
- **Batch operations**: Group similar operations for optimal rendering
