- ✅ Hospital Extension (9 entities, 7 environments)
  - Entities: DOCTOR, NURSE, PATIENT, SURGEON, PARAMEDIC, etc.
  - Environments: HOSPITAL, EXAMINATION_ROOM, OPERATING_ROOM, etc.

### Platform Support
- ✅ **Browser rendering** - Works with HTMLCanvasElement
- ✅ **Node.js rendering** - Works with node-canvas

- ✅ Platform support guide
- ✅ Implementation status badges
- ✅ Documentation review and roadmap
- ✅ Comprehensive examples

### Testing
- ✅ 52 comprehensive parser tests
- ✅ 41 tests passing (79% pass rate)
- ✅ Test coverage for entities, attributes, positioning, extensions

## 🔥 Key Achievements

### Why Hand-Written Parser > ANTLR?
1. ✅ **Simpler** - No Java, no generation step, no external tools
2. ✅ **Better errors** - Context-aware suggestions, not generic "expecting X"
3. ✅ **Easier maintenance** - Direct TypeScript, no grammar files
4. ✅ **Perfect types** - Native TypeScript with full IntelliSense
5. ✅ **Faster** - Optimized for SIGL's line-based syntax
6. ✅ **Smaller** - No 100KB+ generated code

### Platform Abstraction Benefits
1. ✅ **Universal API** - Same code works in browser AND Node.js
2. ✅ **Auto-detection** - No config needed, just works
3. ✅ **Optional deps** - Browser doesn't need node-canvas
4. ✅ **CLI ready** - Built-in terminal support
5. ✅ **Flexible** - Easy to add new platforms
